# Visualising-History-of-Novel-Prize-Winners-

The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. Surely, right?
Well, let's find out! In this project, you get to explore patterns and trends over 100 years worth of Nobel Prize winners. What characteristics do the prize winners have? Which country gets it most often? And has anybody gotten it twice? It's up to you to figure this out.
Took Dataset from Kaggle.
This dataset includes a record for every individual or organization that was awarded the Nobel Prize since 1901.

Tidyverse is a collection of essential R packages for data science. The packages under the tidyverse umbrella help us in performing and interacting with the data. There are a whole host of things you can do with your data, such as subsetting, transforming, visualizing, etc.

So i will be visualizing This Over.
Which country has won the most prizes in each category? What words are most frequently written in the prize motivation? Can you predict the age, gender, and nationality of next year's Nobel laureates?
